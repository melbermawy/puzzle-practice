üß© multi-phase roadmap

each phase will have:
	‚Ä¢	concept lectures (clear, example-driven, not lists)
	‚Ä¢	3‚Äì4 drills (short, targeted)
	‚Ä¢	fusion mini-puzzle (like a tiny assignment 1)
	‚Ä¢	then we advance.

‚∏ª

phase 0 ‚Äì control mastery

goal: automatic fluency with loops, branching, and traversal.

	‚Ä¢	lesson 1 (done): iteration
	‚Ä¢	lesson 2 (in progress): copying & immutability
	‚Ä¢	lesson 3: segmentation & adjacency
	‚Ä¢	fusion puzzle: ‚Äúislands in a grid‚Äù (count contiguous A‚Äôs)

‚∏ª

phase 1 ‚Äì state and mutation

goal: treat data as a world that evolves by rules.

	‚Ä¢	lesson 4: controlled mutation patterns
	‚Ä¢	lesson 5: state-transition logic (pure vs impure updates)
	‚Ä¢	fusion puzzle: ‚Äúgame of life mini‚Äù (update grid rules)

‚∏ª

phase 2 ‚Äì data modeling

goal: translate a real scenario into types and abstractions.

	‚Ä¢	lesson 6: modeling relationships (objects, maps, sets)
	‚Ä¢	lesson 7: composing helpers & decomposition
	‚Ä¢	fusion puzzle: ‚Äúmini booking system‚Äù (one row per room)

‚∏ª

phase 3 ‚Äì composition & reasoning

goal: build small deterministic systems confidently.

	‚Ä¢	lesson 8: functional composition and pipelines
	‚Ä¢	lesson 9: designing internal helpers + testing strategy
	‚Ä¢	fusion puzzle: ‚Äútoy car simulation‚Äù (assignment-2 tier)

‚∏ª

phase 4 ‚Äì meta-coaching (thinking practice)

goal: learn how to think through unseen puzzles.

	‚Ä¢	how to parse specs ‚Üí extract invariants, states, and rules
	‚Ä¢	how to prototype incrementally
	‚Ä¢	debugging & hypothesis loops
	‚Ä¢	dry-run thought experiments before coding
	‚Ä¢	final fusion puzzle: ‚Äúmulti-agent system‚Äù (assignment-2 complexity)
